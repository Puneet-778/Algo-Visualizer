# Algo-Visualizer
Algorithms visualised:
# 1) Sorting Algorithms 
    a) Bubble Sort
    b) Selection Sort 
    c) Merge Sort
    d) Quick Sort
    e) Insertion Sort
# 2) Graph Traversal (Path finding Algos) 
 #   Blind search algorithms such as breadth-first and depth-first exhaust all possibilities; starting from the given node, they iterate over all possible paths until they reach        the goal node. 
 #   Dijkstra follows a greedy approach and is smart path finding algorithm
 
    a) Breadth First Search (BFS) 
    b) Depth First Search (DFS)
    c) Dijkstra

# Functionalities :  
    Sorting section:
    a) User can select any sorting algorithm and can see it's visualisation
    b) User can set any size of array from (1-1000) 
    c) Also implemented speed options to increase/decrease visualization speed

# Path Finding Section: 
    a) Implemented set source and destination which allows user to change starting and end point in the grid  
    b) Also included path blocking by adding obstacles in the grid

# Common : 
    Disables UI while an algorithm is running and can only be stopped using reset button.
